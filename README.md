Here is our repository for the Coding Camp 2025 Capstone project - Machine Learning.

## DESCRIPTION
The Machine Learning model can be used to provide information about a content-based filtering approach for its recommendation system, providing personalized and accurate recommendations for users.


## DATASETS 
This dataset represents the data related to food recommender system. Two datasets are included in this dataset file. First includes the dataset related to the foods, ingredients, cuisines involved. Second, includes the dataset of the rating system for the recommendation system.
